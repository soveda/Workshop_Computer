# CVSeq

A 32-step CV sequencer for the Workshop Computer, after the Performer
modulator in Native Instruments' Massive. Each step plays a *shape* rather than
a single voltage, and the steps run on one after another as one continuous
control voltage. It's edited from a
[Music Thing 8mu](https://www.musicthing.co.uk/8mu_page/), with an optional web
editor.

Built from the same template as WaveSeq: the same 8mu paging and pickup, USB
modes, knob pickup, web editor and presets.

## What a step is

Each step has nine settings, on the 8mu's nine pages:

| Button | First page | Second page | Third page |
|---|---|---|---|
| A | **SHAPE 1**: one of 40 shapes | **START**: level at the start of the step, −100% to +100% | |
| B | **SHAPE 2**: one of 40 shapes | **END**: level at the end of the step, −100% to +100% | |
| C | **MORPH**: from shape 1 (down) to shape 2 (up) | **OFFSET**: a voltage added to the step | |
| D | **LEVEL**: the step's level | **QUANT**: digital stepping of the shape | **CHANCE**: the chance the step plays |

A step's voltage is the morph between its two shapes, times its level, times a
ramp from its START level to its END level across the step, plus its OFFSET.
So START and END (both +100% by default) let a step fade in or out, or tilt a
flat shape into a ramp.

START and END are two-sided: fader down is −100%, the centre 0 (the middle
three positions all read exactly 0) and up +100%. Below the centre the shape is
turned upside down, so both at −100% inverts the step, down to −5 V at full
depth, and a ramp from +100% to −100% swings the step from its shape, through
zero, to its shape inverted. To fade in from silence, start at the centre
rather than the bottom.

**OFFSET** adds −5 V (fader down) to +5 V (fader up) to the step, with the
centre at 0 V, the default. The middle three fader positions all read as
exactly 0 V, so it's easy to find. Depth scales the offset along with the rest
of the step, and the offset knob is added on top. With LEVEL at zero a step is
just its offset, so the faders become a plain stepped-voltage sequencer. With
a scale chosen, a quantised step still snaps to the scale, offset and all. The
output is limited to ±6 V, so a step at full level with a big offset clips.

**QUANT** turns the step into held stairs: fully down is smooth, then 32 stairs
across the step, fewer as it rises, down to one held value at the top.

**Scales.** With the switch up, the Main knob chooses a scale. Off (fully
down, the default) leaves QUANT as above. Any other scale also snaps the
voltage of every step with QUANT above zero to the nearest note of the scale,
1 V/oct with C at 0 V. The snap comes last, after LEVEL, START and END, depth,
offset and smoothing, so a quantised step only ever gives the scale's notes:
a fade-in climbs through the scale, and smoothing slows a change down by
stepping through the notes in between rather than gliding off the scale. Steps
with QUANT fully down stay smooth, so
melodic and smooth steps can share a sequence. CV Out 2 follows the scale for
every step.

The scales, in order round the knob: Off, Chromatic, Major, Minor, Harmonic
minor, Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, Major pentatonic, Minor
pentatonic, Blues, Whole tone, Diminished, Fifths, Octaves. When the scale
changes, LEDs 1-4 show its number in binary for a second (LED 1 the lowest
bit; none lit is Off).

**CHANCE** is rolled each time a step comes round. A step that doesn't play holds
the voltage where it was for its length, and gives no trigger. Default: always.

### The shapes

High, Middle, Low, Ramp up, Ramp down, Triangle, Valley, Hump, Sine, Cosine,
Exp rise, Exp rise x2, Exp rise x3, Exp fall, Exp fall x2, Exp fall x3,
Log rise, Log fall, S rise, S fall, Square, Square late, Pulse, Pulse late,
Stairs up, Stairs down, Saw x2, Saw x3, Saw down x2, Saw down x3,
Triangle x2, Triangle x3, Sine x2, Sine x3, Pluck, Swell, ADSR, Bounce,
Random steps, Random smooth.

The SHAPE faders select from these in order, about three fader positions to a
shape. The "x2" and "x3" shapes repeat two or three times within one step.
Every shape is 0 to 1 across one step; the random shapes are fixed patterns,
the same every time.

## The 8mu

There are 32 steps, in four banks of eight, and the eight faders edit one bank
at a time. The sequence starts 8 steps long (bank A), and its length can be
anything from 1 to 32.

The four buttons are acted on when you **let go**, so how long you held one
decides what it does:

| Do this | To |
|---|---|
| **Short press** A-D | Choose the page. Press the same button again for its next page, and round to its first again: A, B and C have two pages, D three (LEVEL, QUANT, CHANCE). Another button always starts on its first page |
| **Long press** A-D (half a second) | Choose the bank the faders edit: A = steps 1-8, B = 9-16, C = 17-24, D = 25-32. The LED of fader 1-4 for that bank flashes three times |
| **Hold** A-D **and move a fader** | Set the last step: the button is the bank, the fader the step within it. The fader has to move a good way (about a sixth of its travel) to count, so a fader twitching during a long press doesn't change the length. Hold D and move fader 8 for 32 steps; hold A and move fader 4 for 4 steps. The faders up to the last step light briefly. The fader movement doesn't edit anything |

Steps past the end of the sequence keep their settings, so shortening and
lengthening it again loses nothing. On power-up, steps 9-32 start as copies of
steps 1-8.

**Pickup.** After a page change the faders don't do anything until they reach
the value already stored for their step (or pass it), then take it over. So
changing page never makes the voltage jump.

**LEDs.** The 8mu's LEDs show the stored values on the current page, and the
playing step is lit fully. On the Computer, LEDs 1-4 show which button's page
is selected: lit steadily for its first page, blinking slowly for its second
and quickly for its third.

**Motion.** Tilting the 8mu forward and back adds to every step's MORPH. The
first 15 degrees or so either side of flat are ignored, so holding it in your
hand doesn't nudge the morph; tipping it right up still reaches the full range.

Without an 8mu the card plays a default sequence, still under the panel
controls.

## Directions

**Hold the switch down and turn Main** to choose one: the knob's travel is
split into eight zones, in the order of the table below. Turning Main while the
switch is held doesn't touch the scale or the rate; afterwards Main waits to
pick its scale or rate up again, so neither jumps. A quick tap without turning
still steps to the next direction.

While the switch is held, and for a second after, LED 4 is lit to show it's
the direction, and LEDs 1-3 show its number (0-7, in the table's order) in
binary, LED 1 the lowest bit.

| Direction | Steps | Shapes |
|---|---|---|
| Step forward | 1 to the last step | forwards |
| Step ping-pong | 1 to the last, then back (end steps once) | forwards |
| Step backward | the last step to 1 | forwards |
| True ping-pong | 1 to the last, then the last to 1 | forwards, then backwards |
| True reverse | the last step to 1 | backwards |
| Random step | a random step each time, never the same twice running | forwards |
| Random reverse | 1 to the last step | each at random forwards or backwards |
| True random | a random step each time, never the same twice running | each at random forwards or backwards |

The "step" directions change only the order of the steps; each shape still
plays forwards. The "true" directions play the whole sequence backwards, every
shape reversed too, as if the voltage were recorded and played in reverse. True
ping-pong plays step 8 forwards and then backwards at the turn, so the voltage
turns round without a jump (same for step 1 at the other end). Step ping-pong
doesn't repeat the end steps. The random directions roll again at every
step, so they never settle into a loop.

## Panel

| Control | Function |
|---|---|
| Switch up | Main = scale, X = depth (-100% to +100%), Y = offset (-5 V to +5 V) |
| Switch middle | Main = rate (8 s to 10 ms per step), X = smoothing (off across the bottom of the knob, then 1 ms to about 2 s), Y = morph offset (-100% to +100%, all steps) |
| Switch down | Hold and turn Main to choose the direction; tap to step to the next |

All knobs have a small dead zone at each end, so the full range is reached
even if a knob doesn't quite read its very ends, and the two-sided settings
(depth, offset, morph offset) have one in the middle, so exactly 0 is easy to
find.

The six knob settings each keep their value. After the switch moves, a knob
does nothing until it's turned to (or past) its new setting's value, then takes
over. LED 6 (bottom right) blinks fast while a knob is waiting. At power-up the
knobs take over straight away for the position the switch is in; the others
start at depth +100%, offset 0 V, scale Off, one step a second, smoothing off
and morph offset 0.

| Jack | Function |
|---|---|
| CV In 1 | Morph offset: +5 V moves every step all the way from shape 1 to shape 2 |
| CV In 2 | Rate, 1 V/oct |
| Pulse In 1 | Clock: each step lasts one clock, for clocks up to a minute apart. The card follows the clock from its second pulse, and goes back to the rate knob once four of the clock's periods (at least 2 s) pass without one |
| Pulse In 2 | Restart from the first step |
| CV Out 1 | The sequence: offset + depth x the steps (0 to 5 V, or beyond with step OFFSET or a negative START or END), smoothed; ±6 V at most |
| CV Out 2 | CV Out 1 quantised to the scale (to semitones with scale Off), 1 V/oct |
| Audio Out 1 | CV Out 1, uncalibrated |
| Audio Out 2 | CV Out 1 inverted, uncalibrated |
| Pulse Out 1 | Trigger at the start of every step that plays |
| Pulse Out 2 | Trigger at the start of the sequence |

Audio In 1 and 2 are unused. LED 5 (bottom left) follows CV Out 1's level.

## Three ways to use it

| Plugged into the Computer's USB socket | The card is | The faders are |
|---|---|---|
| an 8mu | USB host | the 8mu's, read directly. No computer needed |
| a computer | a USB MIDI device called **CVSeq** | the web editor's, and an 8mu plugged into the *computer* is passed on by the editor |
| nothing | USB host, waiting | (plug an 8mu in any time) |

The card picks its mode once, at power-up, so **after plugging a computer in,
power-cycle the module**. This needs Computer Rev 1.1 hardware; older boards
are always a USB device.

## Web editor

Open [`web/index.html`](web/index.html) in Chrome or Edge, with the computer
plugged into the Computer's USB socket and the module power-cycled, and press
**Connect card & 8mu**. It's a single file and needs no network. The page reads
the sequence from the card, then sends every edit as it's made.

From the top (each section has a − button by its heading that folds it away,
and + to bring it back; the browser remembers which are folded):

- **Readouts.** Step, rate, depth, offset, smoothing, morph offset, scale
  and whether the card is clocked, live from the card. While a knob on the
  module is waiting to pick up its setting, that setting's box has a dotted
  orange outline; it goes once the knob reaches the value.
- **Direction** buttons set the card's direction, and follow it when the
  switch is tapped.
- **Bank, length and shift.** Bank buttons, −/+ for the length, and −/+ to
  shift: every step in the sequence moves one place left or right, all its
  settings with it, the end step wrapping round to the other end (steps past
  the length stay put; Undo takes a shift back). Just above the sequence so
  they stay put as the length changes.
- **Sequence.** All 32 steps, eight to a row, in the same columns as the
  faders. Steps in the sequence are drawn full size as one voltage, with a
  playhead that runs backwards through a reversed step; steps past the end
  shrink to small grey boxes, so on load there are eight steps and three rows
  of boxes. With any step below 0 V or above 5 V (through OFFSET or a negative
  START or END), the rows stretch to fit it. The bank the faders edit has an
  orange box round its row. Faint steps have less than full chance. Click a
  step to select it (and its row's bank).
- **Copy, paste & randomise.** Select steps on the sequence: click one,
  Shift+click a range, Ctrl/⌘+click to add or remove single steps,
  double-click for a whole row, Alt+click for a whole column (the same fader
  in every bank), or use the Row, Column, Sequence and All 32 buttons. Copy
  (Ctrl/⌘+C) takes every setting of the selected steps; Paste (Ctrl/⌘+V) puts
  them back: one copied step fills every selected step, several fill the same
  number of selected steps in order, or else keep their pattern from the first
  selected step. Shift+paste pastes only the page the faders show. Randomise
  changes the shape (shape 1, shape 2 and morph), the shape and levels (plus
  LEVEL, START, END and OFFSET) or everything (plus QUANT and CHANCE), of the
  selected steps, a row, a column or the whole sequence. Levels are fitted so
  each step stays within 0 to +5 V or −5 to +5 V (at full depth), as chosen,
  and LEVEL is kept at 31% or more so a step is never lost. Undo (Ctrl/⌘+Z)
  takes back pastes, randomising and shifts. Clicking a shape gives it to every
  selected step. The keys are listed on the page.
- **Faders.** Nine pages, each showing the selected bank's eight steps, as on
  the 8mu.
- **CV Out 1.** A scope of the last four seconds of the output.
- **Shapes.** All 40. Click one to give it to the selected step.
- **8mu on the computer.** Its faders, buttons and tilt drive the page, with
  the same pickup as the card, and the page lights its LEDs as the card would.
- **Inputs & outputs, 8mu and Sequencer.** Cards on the right: every jack
  and what it does; the 8mu's buttons (page, bank, last step), pickup, LEDs
  and tilt; and how a step and the sequence work, with the panel controls.
- **Readouts** include the rate and, under it, the whole sequence's length in
  time.
- **Presets.** Eight built in (Offset melody shows OFFSET as a step sequencer), plus your own, kept in the browser. Save,
  update, rename, delete, export and import as JSON. Loading one sends it to
  the card.

Without a card the page still edits, previews and keeps presets, with a
simulated playhead at one step a second.

The protocol is documented in [`sysex.h`](sysex.h). The card and the editor
must be the same version: this one (protocol 4) won't talk to older
firmware. Presets saved before OFFSET still load, with every offset 0 V, and presets
saved before START and END went two-sided are converted so they sound the
same (their 0% becomes the centre).

## Building

```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. && make
```

Needs the Pico SDK. `EightMU.h` and `ComputerCard.h` are copied from
`Demonstrations+HelloWorlds/PicoSDK/ComputerCard`.

## Not yet

- Sequences aren't saved on the card, so they're lost at power-off. Keep them
  as presets in the web editor and send them again after power-up.
